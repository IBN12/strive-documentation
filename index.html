                    <div>
                        Tobosian, the young fighter is a Muy Thai practitioner from Thailand who
                        was granted the status of an Initiator at a young age. He now resides in the Council
                        Zonis Region after escaping the deadly rebellion massacre in the International Southeast 
                        Coalition Region. Back home was a different story for him when it came to his overall 
                        lifestyle. His mother passed away when he was at the age of 8 and he's never
                        met his father. His Grandma was the one that raised him into his adolescent years. He 
                        was recoginize for his graceful, yet fierce fighting skills in the combat sport Muy Thai.
                        He won many matches and tournaments to where he could earn a living off prize earnings
                        and local sponsorships. This all came to suden halt during the rebellion massacre.
                        <br /><br />
                        After fleeing Thailand, he began working at a docking center that packages
                        fish and rarely goes out at night unless it's for one of his legalized ring fights in the
                        city of Potomac. Tobosian would meet a man named Fate who walked into his place of work one day.
                        Fate discussed that he's been keeping a watchful eye on Tobosian and has a great 
                        opportunity that will not only change his life, but his vary soul. Fate asked Tobosian
                        how confident he was in being an Initiator. Tobosian had no recollection of what that meant
                        and didn't want to be bothered with anything that Fate was offering. Fate explains only bits
                        and pieces about the new life that Tobosian would experience. He leaves his personal card on
                        a table next to Tobosian and leaves the vincinity. Tobosian reviews the card and thinks about
                        everything Fate told him.

                    <div>
                        The son of Shane The Man. The true definition of a human that lives beyond
                        principality with no shame. He neglects the common interest of any other human
                        being and shows no remorse when it comes to putting himself at a higher level, even
                        if it means ruining the lives of others. Mac is known around town as the city snitch.

                    <div>
                        Jace Hearts, The One From System. The one who defies the system for everything that it's
                        worth. Jace is from Original Oregon Region before it was flooded by System. Jace
                        was a part of a small activist group back home that opposed all the Council's legislations 
                        and zoning takeovers that made 80 percent of local citizens homeless. Jace's mother moved South
                        of the country to escape the destruction and advised Jace to follow suit, but his hard headed nature
                        prevailed. After losing a friend named Rondo to a heavy dispute over zoning with regional officers,
                        Jace decides to leave the Original Oregon Region to escape the madness. He settles in the Council 
                        capital city, Potomac, and joins up with a new activist group called "The Hounds". 
                        <br /><br />
                        Jace would receive orders from The Hounds to gather data about the Council injecting the food and water
                        supplies with chemical solutions such as Quantums Rift. He takes a job at a popular corporate store
                        that is possibly involved in this fiasco to find any evidence of Quantum Rift storages. This would be
                        Jace's first encounter with Allybelle and Angel Steel. Both Jace and AllyBelle formed a peculiarly
                        relationship. Jace would later discover that the company was in fact assisting the Council by 
                        contaminating the food and water supplies in various regions. This led to him being fired for violating company
                        policy. He was able to use this data to help The Hounds convince the people to riot and protest in
                        the West Section of the city. This helped the Hounds to destroy a Council Control
                        Station since all the focus and energy was put on stopping the protestors and rioters. Things
                        would eventually take a dark turn on the day of the rebellion plot.
